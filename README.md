# 👋 Hi, I'm Benjamin

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with **2 years of experience**, currently working with **TypeScript, NestJS, and Next.js**.  
I love solving problems, optimizing performance, and building sleek, scalable applications.

I started coding with low-level languages like **C**, then explored **Python**, but I quickly fell in love with web development.  
Now, I specialize in crafting modern web applications, from backend APIs to dynamic front-end interfaces.
